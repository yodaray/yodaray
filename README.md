- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yodaray
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science on my own so I will try to do data analysis by using the data on Kaggle.
- This github page will be my record of my learning process on data science.
    Please feel free to point out my mistakes on the analysis part.
    Programme for the data analysis -----STATA16 / Python (Jupyter notebook)
